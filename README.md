# 240projects
<p>This is a collection of the multiple projects I did in my CSCE 240 class during the Fall 2021 semester. We programmed in C++, and learned multiple different topics, such as
* Memory management
* Pointers
* Operator overloading
* Using the STL, and more<br>
We also covered using Google Tests, following a style guide (the Google style guide in this case), and using linters (cpplint) to make sure code follows the style guide.<br>
I do not have commit history in this repository because I cannot fork from a GitHub Classroom repository.</p>
