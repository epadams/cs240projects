# 240projects
This is a collection of the multiple projects I did in my CSCE 240 class during the Fall 2021 semester. We programmed in C++, and learned multiple different topics, such as memory management, pointers, operator overloading, using the STL, and more. 
We also covered using Google Tests, following a style guide (the Google style guide in this case), and using linters (cpplint) to make sure code follows the style guide.
I do not have commit history in this repository because I cannot fork from a GitHub Classroom repository.
